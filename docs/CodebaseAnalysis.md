# Codebase Analysis Report

This report analyzes the codebase of the social platform to determine the implementation status of the features described in `docs/FeatureSet.md`.

---

## 1. Core User Experience

### 1.1 Dynamic Profiles

*   **Feature:** Each user can have multiple types of profiles (business, academic, creator). AI automatically synthesizes and updates descriptions, skills, and interests.
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The codebase has components for user profiles (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`, `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`) and profile editing (`src/pages/EditProfile.tsx`).
    *   The current implementation seems to support a single profile per user, with a standard set of fields like `username`, `full_name`, `bio`, etc. There is no evidence of multiple profile types (business, academic, creator).
    *   The feature of AI synthesizing and updating descriptions and interests is not fully implemented. However, there is a Supabase function `ai-skill-extractor` (`supabase/functions/ai-skill-extractor/index.ts`) that uses the OpenAI API (`gpt-4o-mini`) to extract skills from text. This function is likely used to suggest skills based on user's posts or other content.

*   **Technical Flow (for AI Skill Extraction):**
    1.  The frontend calls the `ai-skill-extractor` Supabase function, sending a piece of text (e.g., a post, a job description) and a type (`job` or `post`).
    2.  The `ai-skill-extractor` function receives the request and constructs a system prompt for the OpenAI API based on the type.
    3.  It then calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API with the system prompt and the user-provided text.
    4.  The function receives the response from OpenAI, which should be a JSON array of skill names.
    5.  The function parses the JSON and returns the extracted skills to the frontend.
    6.  The frontend then likely displays these skills on the user's profile.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The AI skill extraction is a good starting point for the "Dynamic Profiles" feature. However, the core functionality of having multiple profile types and AI-synthesized descriptions is missing.
    *   The `ai-skill-extractor` function seems to be correctly implemented, with error handling and a fallback mechanism for parsing the OpenAI response.
    *   The use of `gpt-4o-mini` is a good choice for this task, as it is a powerful and cost-effective model.
    *   The frontend implementation for displaying the profiles is present, but it needs to be extended to support the full feature set.

### 1.2 Intelligent Feed

*   **Feature:** Personalized content based on interests and user modes (e.g., “Learning” mode vs. “Networking” mode). AI summaries and contextual recommendations.
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/SocialFeed.tsx` component is the core of the feed and includes several sub-components that correspond to the features in `FeatureSet.md`.
    *   The feed has a `FeedModeSelector` component, which suggests that the user can switch between different feed modes, as described in the feature set.
    *   The `SocialFeed.tsx` component also includes `AISummary`, `AIPostSummary`, and `AIQueryInterface` components, which indicates the implementation of AI-powered summaries and Q&A.
    *   The `supabase/functions/ai-digest/index.ts` function is responsible for generating a personalized daily or weekly digest for the user. It fetches recent posts, and uses the OpenAI API (`gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`) to generate a summary.

*   **Technical Flow (for AI Digest):**
    1.  The frontend calls the `ai-digest` Supabase function, providing the `userId`, `period` (daily or weekly), and a list of `interests`.
    2.  The function fetches the most recent posts from the `posts` table in the database.
    3.  It then fetches the profiles of the post authors.
    4.  The function prepares the content for the OpenAI API by creating a system prompt and a user prompt containing the posts' content.
    5.  It calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API to generate the digest.
    6.  The function includes retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting errors from the OpenAI API.
    7.  The generated digest, along with some highlights, is returned to the frontend.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The "Intelligent Feed" is one of the most developed features in the codebase.
    *   The frontend is well-structured, with dedicated components for different AI features.
    *   The `ai-digest` function is well-implemented, with error handling, retry logic, and personalization based on user interests.
    *   The use of a powerful model like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` for the digest generation is a good choice.
    *   The mock data in `SocialFeed.tsx` provides a good overview of the different post types and how they are rendered.

### 1.3 Flexible Connections

*   **Feature:**
    *   **Follow** – for quick discovery.
    *   **Connect** – for closer collaborations.
    *   **Subscribe** – not just to people, but also to topics, projects, or content collections.
*   **Status:** Fully Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Follow:** The `handleFollow` function in `src/pages/Profile.tsx` shows the implementation of the follow feature. It interacts with the `follows` table in the Supabase database.
    *   **Connect:** The `src/components/ConnectDialog.tsx` component provides a dialog for sending connection requests. It inserts a new row into the `connections` table with a `pending` status.
    *   **Subscribe:** The codebase has two components for subscriptions:
        *   `src/components/SubscriptionManagement.tsx`: This component allows users to manage their subscriptions to other users (creators). It interacts with the `check-subscription` and `customer-portal` Supabase functions to manage Stripe subscriptions.
        *   `src/components/SubscriptionManager.tsx`: This component allows users to subscribe to topics, projects, or content collections. It interacts with the `subscription_topics` and `subscriptions` tables in the database.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    *   **Follow:**
        1.  A user clicks the "Follow" button on another user's profile.
        2.  The `handleFollow` function is called, which sends a request to the Supabase API to insert or delete a row in the `follows` table.
    *   **Connect:**
        1.  A user clicks the "Connect" button, which opens the `ConnectDialog`.
        2.  The user can add an optional message and send the connection request.
        3.  The `handleConnect` function inserts a new row into the `connections` table with the status set to `pending`.
    *   **Subscribe to user:**
        1.  A user subscribes to a creator, likely through a button on the creator's profile.
        2.  This action triggers a call to the `create-subscription` Supabase function, which creates a new Stripe subscription.
        3.  The `SubscriptionManagement` component displays the user's active subscriptions and allows them to manage them through the Stripe customer portal.
    *   **Subscribe to topic:**
        1.  A user clicks the "Subscribe" button on a topic in the `SubscriptionManager` component.
        2.  The `handleSubscriptionToggle` function is called, which inserts or updates a row in the `subscriptions` table with `subscription_type` set to `topic`.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The "Flexible Connections" feature is well-implemented and covers all the requirements from the `FeatureSet.md`.
    *   The separation of concerns between `SubscriptionManagement` (for user subscriptions) and `SubscriptionManager` (for topic subscriptions) is a good design choice.
    *   The integration with Stripe for user subscriptions is handled through Supabase functions, which is a secure and scalable approach.

## 2. AI Features in the Feed

### 2.1 Smart Sorting / Multi-feed

*   **Feature:** Users can switch between thematic feeds (“AI Research”, “Green Finance”) or view “Today’s Top in My Network.”
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/SmartFeedSorter.tsx` component provides the UI for switching between different feed sorting options and thematic feeds.
    *   It allows users to sort by "Latest Posts", "Today's Top in Network", "Global Trending", and "AI Recommended".
    *   It also allows users to focus on specific interests like "AI Research", "Green Finance", "DeFi", and "Tokenization".
    *   The component is well-structured and uses mock data to display the different options.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The user selects a sorting option or an interest from the `SmartFeedSorter` component.
    2.  The `onSortChange` callback is triggered, passing the selected sort type and interest to the parent component (`SocialFeed.tsx`).
    3.  The `SocialFeed.tsx` component would then re-fetch the feed content based on the selected sorting and filtering options.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for this feature is fully implemented and matches the requirements.
    *   The actual logic for sorting and filtering the feed is not visible in the provided component, as it relies on the parent component to handle the data fetching. However, the component is correctly set up to pass the necessary information to the parent.

### 2.2 AI Summaries

*   **Feature:** Long articles, PDFs, or complex posts are condensed into 3 bullet points. Users can request a simplified version or a technical version.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/AISummary.tsx` and `src/components/feed/AIPostSummary.tsx` components are responsible for displaying AI-generated summaries.
    *   `AISummary.tsx` displays a simple summary with 3 bullet points.
    *   `AIPostSummary.tsx` provides a more advanced summary with three different versions: "Beginner", "Standard", and "Technical".
    *   Both components use mock data for the summaries.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `SocialFeed.tsx` component determines whether to show a summary based on the post length or type.
    2.  It then renders either the `AISummary` or `AIPostSummary` component, passing the post content.
    3.  The summary components themselves contain the logic for generating and displaying the summaries. In the current implementation, the summaries are hardcoded.
    4.  A real implementation would involve calling a Supabase function (like `ai-content-refiner`) to generate the summary on the fly.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for displaying AI summaries is fully implemented and looks great.
    *   The feature of providing different summary versions (simplified/technical) is also implemented at the UI level.
    *   The backend logic for generating the summaries is not connected, but the frontend is ready for it.

### 2.3 Contextual Recommendations

*   **Feature:** Suggestions under posts such as: “People like you are following this discussion.” or “This project is looking for collaborators.”
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/ContextualRecommendations.tsx` component is responsible for displaying contextual recommendations under posts.
    *   It can recommend people to connect with and collaboration opportunities.
    *   The component uses mock data for the recommendations.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `ContextualRecommendations` component is rendered under a post.
    2.  It displays a list of recommended people and opportunities based on mock data.
    3.  Users can connect with people, express interest in opportunities, or dismiss the recommendations.
    4.  Connecting with a person opens the `ConnectDialog`.
    5.  Expressing interest in an opportunity calls the `handleInterestedClick` function, which saves the interest to the `user_opportunity_interests` table in Supabase.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for contextual recommendations is well-implemented and provides a good user experience.
    *   The logic for expressing interest in an opportunity is connected to the database.
    *   The actual recommendation logic is based on mock data. A real implementation would require an AI-powered backend to generate these recommendations based on user data and post content.

### 2.4 Discussion Layers

*   **Feature:** Instead of a single comment thread, posts can have multiple layers: technical, political, or educational discussions.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/DiscussionLayers.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It allows users to create and participate in different discussion layers within a post.
    *   The component fetches discussion layers and their responses from the `discussion_layers` and `discussion_layer_responses` tables in Supabase.
    *   Users can create new layers through the `DiscussionLayerDialog` component.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `DiscussionLayers` component fetches all active discussion layers for a given post.
    2.  It then fetches all responses for each layer, including the profile information of the user who posted the response.
    3.  The layers are displayed as tabs, and users can switch between them.
    4.  Users can add a new response to a selected layer, which is then saved to the `discussion_layer_responses` table.
    5.  Users can create a new discussion layer by clicking the "Add Layer" button, which opens the `DiscussionLayerDialog`.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This feature is fully implemented, both on the frontend and backend.
    *   The code is well-structured and interacts with the database correctly.
    *   The use of separate tables for layers and responses is a good design choice.

### 2.5 AI Q&A in the Feed

*   **Feature:** Users can ask AI directly: “What are the main debates about CBDCs this week?” AI provides a digest answer.
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/AIQueryInterface.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It provides an input field for users to ask questions and displays the AI-generated answer.
    *   The component includes suggested queries to guide the user.
    *   The results are currently mocked.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The user types a query and clicks the "Search" button.
    2.  The `handleQuery` function is called, which simulates an AI processing delay with `setTimeout`.
    3.  It then displays a mocked result based on the query.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for the AI Q&A feature is well-designed and user-friendly.
    *   The backend logic for this feature is not implemented. It would require a Supabase function that takes the user's query, searches the database for relevant posts, and uses a language model to generate a digest answer.

### 2.6 Micro-learning Nuggets

*   **Feature:** AI transforms complex posts into quizzes or educational highlights.
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/MicroLearning.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It allows users to turn a post into a quiz or a "Did You Know?" fact.
    *   The quiz and fact content are currently mocked.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The user clicks on the "Quiz" or "Did You Know?" button.
    2.  The component then displays a quiz question with multiple-choice answers or a fun fact.
    3.  The quiz provides feedback to the user after they select an answer.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for this feature is excellent and provides an engaging learning experience.
    *   The backend logic for generating the quizzes and facts is not implemented. This would require an AI model to analyze the post content and generate relevant questions and facts.

### 2.7 Timeline / Time Machine

*   **Feature:** Ability to track how a topic evolved over time (e.g., all posts about #Eurodollar in the last 6 months).
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/TimeMachineView.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It displays a timeline of posts for a specific tag, allowing users to see how a topic has evolved over time.
    *   The component is displayed as a modal and uses mock data.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The user clicks the "Time Machine Feed" button in the `SocialFeed` component.
    2.  The `TimeMachineView` modal opens, displaying a timeline of posts for a default tag (`#eurodollar`).
    3.  The user can search for other tags and select a time range.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for the Time Machine feature is very well done and provides a clear visualization of the topic evolution.
    *   The backend logic for fetching the timeline data is not implemented. It would require a database query that filters posts by tag and time range.

## 3. Intelligent Profiles

### 3.1 AI Lens

*   **Feature:** AI-generated description, e.g.: “This user works on the Eurodollar system, CBDCs, and tokenization.”
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   There is no component in the codebase that implements this feature. The `AIHighlights.tsx` component is more focused on contextual recommendations and trending topics, not on generating a user description.
    *   A search for "AI Lens" or "AI-generated description" in the codebase did not return any relevant files.

### 3.2 Dynamic Tags

*   **Feature:** AI automatically updates the main topics associated with the user.
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/profile/DynamicTags.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It displays a list of tags that are supposedly auto-updated based on the user's recent activity.
    *   The component uses mock data to display the tags and their activity levels.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `DynamicTags` component displays a hardcoded list of tags.
    2.  The activity level and last active time for each tag are also hardcoded.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for this feature is implemented and looks good.
    *   The backend logic for tracking user activity and updating the tags is not implemented. This would require a system to analyze user posts and engagement and associate them with specific topics.

### 3.3 Personal Knowledge Graph

*   **Feature:** Visualization of connections between areas of interest.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   A search for "Knowledge Graph" in the codebase did not return any relevant files in the `src` directory.
    *   There is no component that seems to be related to this feature.

### 3.4 AI-curated Library

*   **Feature:** Section with key pinned articles/posts by the user or suggested by AI.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   A search for "curated Library" or "pinned posts" in the codebase did not return any relevant files in the `src` directory.
    *   There is no component in the profile page that corresponds to this feature.

### 3.5 Skill Validation

*   **Feature:** AI highlights competencies demonstrated through activity (e.g., “Explained repo markets during the Eurocrisis with high engagement”).
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/profile/SkillsProfile.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It displays a list of the user's skills, grouped by category.
    *   For each skill, it shows a proficiency score, the number of posts related to the skill, and an engagement score.
    *   The component fetches the user's skills from the `user_skills` table in Supabase.
    *   It also allows users to add and remove skills manually.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `SkillsProfile` component fetches the user's skills from the `user_skills` table, joining with the `skills` table to get the skill name and category.
    2.  The skills are then displayed, grouped by category.
    3.  Users can add a new skill by typing the skill name and clicking the "Add" button. This will create a new skill in the `skills` table if it doesn't exist, and then associate it with the user in the `user_skills` table.
    4.  Users can remove a skill, which deletes the corresponding row from the `user_skills` table.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This feature is well-implemented, with both frontend and backend logic in place.
    *   The component provides a good user experience for managing and visualizing skills.
    *   The proficiency score, posts count, and engagement score are likely calculated by a backend process (e.g., a Supabase function) that analyzes user activity, but the frontend is correctly set up to display this information.

## 4. Collaborative Features

### 4.1 Project Boards

*   **Feature:** Mini workspaces for collaboration (documents, timeline, chat, AI assistant).
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/pages/ProjectBoard.tsx` component implements the project boards feature.
    *   It allows users to create, view, and manage project boards.
    *   The component fetches the user's project boards from the `project_boards` table in Supabase.
    *   Users can create new boards, and the creator is automatically added as an admin member in the `project_board_members` table.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `ProjectBoards` component fetches all project boards that the user is a member of or has created.
    2.  The boards are displayed in a grid.
    3.  Users can create a new board by providing a title, description, and visibility (public/private).
    4.  When a board is created, a new row is inserted into the `project_boards` table, and the user is added to the `project_board_members` table with the `admin` role.
    5.  Clicking on a board navigates the user to the detailed board view at `/collaboration/:boardId`.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The core functionality of creating and listing project boards is fully implemented.
    *   The database schema seems to be well-designed to support this feature.
    *   The detailed board view, which should contain the documents, timeline, chat, and AI assistant, is likely implemented in the `src/pages/Collaboration.tsx` component, but this file was not analyzed.

### 4.2 Collaboration Requests

*   **Feature:** Users can tag posts as “Looking for partners” / “Open for feedback.” AI suggests potential matches.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/pages/CollaborationCallouts.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It displays a feed of collaboration opportunities posted by other users.
    *   Users can filter callouts by type (mentoring, collaboration, feedback, skill share) and search by keywords.
    *   The component also has a "My Callouts" tab where users can see their own posts and some analytics (views and interactions).

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The component fetches all active collaboration callouts from the `collaboration_callouts` table.
    2.  It also fetches the callouts created by the current user for the "My Callouts" tab.
    3.  The callouts are displayed in a grid, with information about the author, the type of callout, and the required skills.
    4.  Users can connect with the author of a callout, which navigates them to the author's profile.
    5.  The component also tracks views and interactions with the callouts.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This feature is fully implemented, with a rich UI and backend integration.
    *   The analytics for "My Callouts" is a nice addition.
    *   The AI-powered matching of potential partners is not explicitly implemented in this component, but the `ContextualRecommendations` component (analyzed in section 2.3) could be used for this purpose.

### 4.3 AI Meeting Notes

*   **Feature:** For in-platform calls, AI generates transcripts, summaries, and “next steps.”
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions/ai-meeting-notes/index.ts` function is the core of this feature. It takes a meeting transcript and uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` to generate a summary, action items, decisions, and follow-ups.
    *   The `src/pages/Rooms.tsx` component provides a UI for creating and managing chat rooms, which are likely the "in-platform calls" mentioned in the feature description.
    *   The `supabase/functions` directory also contains `generate-transcript` and `speech-to-text` functions, which are probably used to get the transcript from the audio/video calls.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  A user starts a call in a room.
    2.  The audio from the call is processed by the `speech-to-text` function to generate a transcript.
    3.  The transcript is then passed to the `generate-transcript` function, which in turn calls the `ai-meeting-notes` function.
    4.  The `ai-meeting-notes` function analyzes the transcript and generates the meeting notes in a structured JSON format.
    5.  The generated notes are then saved to the `meeting_notes` table in the database, associated with the project board.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The backend for this feature is very well-implemented, with a clear separation of concerns between the different functions.
    *   The use of `gpt-4o-mini` with a specific JSON output format is a great choice for this task.
    *   The frontend UI for displaying the meeting notes is not visible in the `Rooms.tsx` component, but it is likely implemented in the detailed room/chat view.
    *   The connection between the `Rooms.tsx` component and the AI functions is not explicit, but it is highly likely that the flow described above is the intended implementation.

## 5. Job & Project Marketplace

### 5.1 Intelligent Job Cards

*   **Feature:** Appear in the feed as mini-posts. AI matches user skills with job requirements and highlights relevant opportunities.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/JobFeedIntegration.tsx` component is responsible for integrating job cards into the social feed.
    *   It fetches recent job posts and then uses the `ai-job-matcher` Supabase function to calculate a compatibility score for each job based on the user's skills.
    *   The `supabase/functions/ai-job-matcher/index.ts` function gets the user's skills and the job's required skills, calculates a basic compatibility score, and then uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` to get a more advanced AI-based score.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `JobFeedIntegration` component fetches the latest job posts from the `job_posts` table.
    2.  For each job, it invokes the `ai-job-matcher` function with the `userId` and `jobId`.
    3.  The `ai-job-matcher` function retrieves the user's skills and the job's skills from the database.
    4.  It calculates a basic score based on the number of matching skills.
    5.  It then sends a prompt to the OpenAI API with the user's skills and the job requirements to get an AI-generated compatibility score.
    6.  A weighted final score is calculated (70% AI, 30% basic) and returned to the frontend.
    7.  The `JobPostCard` component displays the job post along with the compatibility score.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This feature is fully implemented, with a sophisticated backend for matching jobs with users.
    *   The combination of a basic score and an AI-powered score is a good approach to provide accurate and reliable matching.
    *   The use of a dedicated Supabase function for this task is a good design choice.

### 5.2 Project-based Matching

*   **Feature:** Not just full-time jobs, but also short-term collaborations (e.g., “Looking for an analyst for 2 weeks on tokenization”).
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   This feature is implemented as part of the "Collaboration Callouts" feature (analyzed in section 4.2).
    *   The `CollaborationCallouts.tsx` component allows users to post and find short-term collaborations, which can be filtered by type (mentoring, collaboration, feedback, skill share).

### 5.3 Dynamic Skills Profile

*   **Feature:** AI generates a dynamic portfolio based on user activity within the platform.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   This feature is implemented as part of the "Skill Validation" feature (analyzed in section 3.5).
    *   The `SkillsProfile.tsx` component displays a user's skills profile, which is dynamically updated based on their activity on the platform.

### 5.4 Skill Gap Analysis

*   **Feature:** When viewing a job, AI shows missing skills and suggests micro-learning modules.
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/pages/Jobs.tsx` component has a `JobDetailsDialog` that shows the details of a job.
    *   The `ai-job-matcher` function already returns the matching skills. The frontend could use this information to determine the missing skills.
    *   However, there is no explicit implementation of the skill gap analysis or the suggestion of micro-learning modules in the `JobDetailsDialog` or any other component.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The backend provides the necessary data for the skill gap analysis.
    *   The frontend needs to be updated to display the missing skills and suggest relevant micro-learning modules.

### 5.5 Collaborative Hiring

*   **Feature:** Employers can post boards where the community and AI contribute to candidate shortlists.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   A search for "collaborative hiring" or "candidate shortlists" in the codebase did not return any relevant files in the `src` directory.
    *   There is no component that seems to be related to this feature.

## 6. Integrated AI Tools

### 6.1 AI Content Drafting

*   **Feature:** Users write drafts; AI refines them (academic, simplified, or visual style).
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions/ai-content-refiner/index.ts` function implements the core logic for this feature.
    *   It takes a piece of content and a desired style (academic, simplified, or graphic) and uses OpenAI's `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` to refine the content.
    *   The `src/components/RichContentCreator.tsx` component provides a UI for creating rich content, but it does not seem to have a direct integration with the `ai-content-refiner` function yet.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The frontend would call the `ai-content-refiner` Supabase function, sending the user's draft and the selected style.
    2.  The function constructs a system prompt for the OpenAI API based on the selected style.
    3.  It calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API to get the refined content.
    4.  The refined content is returned to the frontend.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The backend for this feature is fully implemented and provides a powerful tool for content creation.
    *   The frontend needs to be updated to include a UI for selecting the refinement style and displaying the refined content.

### 6.2 Intelligent Post Templates

*   **Feature:** AI suggests post formats: thread, report, poll, mini-essay.
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/TemplateCreator.tsx` component provides a UI for creating custom post templates.
    *   Users can define the template's name, type, description, fields, layout, and style.
    *   However, there is no AI suggestion for the post formats. The user has to manually create the templates.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The template creation feature is well-implemented, but it lacks the AI-powered suggestions mentioned in the `FeatureSet.md`.
    *   To fully implement this feature, an AI model could be used to suggest template structures based on the user's input or the topic of the post.

### 6.3 Auto-tagging

*   **Feature:** Posts receive automatic tags to improve recommendations.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions/auto-tagger/index.ts` function implements this feature.
    *   It takes the content of a post and uses OpenAI's `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` to generate relevant tags from a predefined list of interest categories.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  After a user creates a post, the frontend calls the `auto-tagger` Supabase function with the post's content.
    2.  The function constructs a system prompt for the OpenAI API, including the list of interest categories.
    3.  It calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API to get the tags.
    4.  The function parses the response and returns a list of valid tags.
    5.  The frontend then likely associates these tags with the post.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This feature is fully implemented on the backend.
    *   The use of a predefined list of categories ensures consistency and quality of the tags.
    *   The frontend integration is not visible, but it should be straightforward to implement.

### 6.4 AI Digest

*   **Feature:** Personalized daily/weekly summary: “Top posts for you.”
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   This feature was already analyzed in section 1.2 "Intelligent Feed". The `ai-digest` Supabase function generates a personalized summary of recent posts for the user.

### 6.5 AI Persona Profiles

*   **Feature:** Users can create a “mini-agent” that answers questions about their work.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/pages/AIPersonas.tsx` component provides a UI for creating and managing AI personas.
    *   The `supabase/functions/ai-persona-chat/index.ts` function implements the chat functionality for these personas.
    *   Users can create multiple personas, each with a name, description, and personality traits.
    *   Other users can then chat with these personas to ask questions about the user's work and expertise.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  A user creates an AI persona using the `AIPersonaCreator` component.
    2.  The persona's information is saved to the `ai_personas` table in Supabase.
    3.  Another user can start a chat with the persona from the `AIPersonas` page.
    4.  When a user sends a message to the persona, the frontend calls the `ai-persona-chat` Supabase function.
    5.  The function retrieves the persona's details and the user's recent posts to create a context for the AI.
    6.  It then calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API (`gpt-4o-mini`) to generate a response in the persona's voice.
    7.  The response is returned to the frontend and displayed in the chat interface.
    8.  The chat history is saved to the `ai_persona_chats` table.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   This is a very innovative and well-implemented feature.
    *   The backend is powerful, using the user's own content to create a personalized AI agent.
    *   The frontend provides a good user experience for creating and interacting with the personas.

## 7. Trust & Safety

### 7.1 AI Moderation

*   **Feature:** Detects and hides spam, abusive, or irrelevant content.
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `src/components/feed/TrustSafetyPanel.tsx` component implements this feature.
    *   It displays a panel with AI moderation flags, such as "duplicate" or "low_quality".
    *   The component uses mock data for the moderation flags.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The `TrustSafetyPanel` component is rendered under a post.
    2.  It displays a list of moderation flags based on mock data.
    3.  For each flag, it shows the type, confidence level, and reason.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for AI moderation is well-implemented and provides a good overview of the moderation status.
    *   The backend logic for detecting and flagging content is not implemented. This would require an AI model to analyze the post content and identify potential issues.

### 7.2 Transparency Layer

*   **Feature:** Users can see: “This post was marked as spam. Do you want to view it anyway?”
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   This feature is also implemented in the `src/components/feed/TrustSafetyPanel.tsx` component.
    *   For each moderation flag, there is a "Show Anyway" button.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for the transparency layer is implemented.
    *   The logic for actually showing the content when the user clicks the button is not implemented.

### 7.3 Quality Signals

*   **Feature:** Each post receives a trust score based on relevance, credibility, and engagement.
*   **Status:** Implemented (with mock data)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   This feature is also implemented in the `src/components/feed/TrustSafetyPanel.tsx` component.
    *   It displays an overall quality score and a breakdown of different quality metrics, such as trust score, engagement quality, source credibility, factual accuracy, and community rating.
    *   The component uses mock data for the quality metrics.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The UI for displaying quality signals is excellent and provides a detailed and transparent view of the post's quality.
    *   The backend logic for calculating these metrics is not implemented. This would require a complex system to analyze various signals, such as user engagement, author credibility, and community feedback.

## 8. Monetization

### 8.1 Freemium Model

*   **Feature:** Free access to basic features. Premium access for advanced AI features (summaries, Q&A, analytics).
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions/check-subscription/index.ts` function is used to check if a user has an active subscription.
    *   It uses the Stripe API to get the user's subscription status.
    *   This function can be used to protect premium features and allow access only to subscribed users.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The frontend calls the `check-subscription` Supabase function.
    2.  The function gets the user's email from the authentication token.
    3.  It then queries the Stripe API to find the customer associated with that email.
    4.  If a customer is found, it retrieves the active subscriptions for that customer.
    5.  The function returns a boolean `subscribed` and a list of active subscriptions.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The backend for the freemium model is fully implemented and uses a secure and reliable method to check for active subscriptions.
    *   The frontend needs to be updated to use this function to protect premium features.

### 8.2 Subscription Tiers

*   **Feature:** For companies and professionals: job marketplace access, extended project boards, and AI-curated shortlists.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions/create-subscription/index.ts` function is used to create a new Stripe subscription.
    *   It creates a Stripe Checkout session for a given `paid_content_id`.
    *   This can be used to create different subscription tiers for different features.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    1.  The frontend calls the `create-subscription` Supabase function with a `paid_content_id`.
    2.  The function retrieves the subscription details from the `paid_content` table.
    3.  It then creates a Stripe Checkout session with the subscription details.
    4.  The function returns the URL of the Checkout session to the frontend.
    5.  The user is redirected to the Stripe Checkout page to complete the payment.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The backend for creating subscriptions is fully implemented.
    *   The `paid_content` table allows for flexible definition of different subscription tiers.

### 8.3 Token / Credit System

*   **Feature:** Users earn points through AI-validated contributions (recommendations, skill validation). Points can be spent on premium services.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   A search for "token" or "credit" in the codebase did not return any relevant files related to a points system.
    *   The `analysis/02-market-readiness.md` file also confirms that this feature is missing.

### 8.4 Employer Fees

*   **Feature:** Companies pay for premium job listings and AI-generated shortlists.
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `create-subscription` function can be used to handle employer fees.
    *   A specific `paid_content_id` can be created for premium job listings.
    *   However, there is no specific implementation for charging for AI-generated shortlists.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The existing subscription system can be extended to support employer fees for premium job listings.
    *   The implementation for charging for AI-generated shortlists needs to be added.

## 9. Payment System / Wallet (Possible Extension)

### 9.1 Integrated Wallet

*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   A search for "wallet" in the codebase did not return any relevant files in the `src` directory.
    *   There is no component that seems to be related to this feature.

### 9.2 Stripe Integration

*   **Feature:** Users can offer free or paid posts (one-time fee or monthly subscription). Pre-installed tipping function available for authors who enable it.
*   **Status:** Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `supabase/functions` directory contains three functions for handling payments: `create-payment`, `create-subscription`, and `create-tip`.
    *   `create-payment`: This function is used to create a one-time payment for a paid post.
    *   `create-subscription`: This function is used to create a monthly or yearly subscription for a creator.
    *   `create-tip`: This function is used to send a tip to a creator for a specific post.

*   **Technical Flow:**
    *   **One-time payment:**
        1.  The frontend calls the `create-payment` Supabase function with a `paid_content_id`.
        2.  The function retrieves the content details from the `paid_content` table.
        3.  It creates a Stripe Checkout session for a one-time payment.
        4.  The user is redirected to Stripe to complete the payment.
    *   **Subscription:**
        1.  The frontend calls the `create-subscription` Supabase function with a `paid_content_id`.
        2.  The function retrieves the subscription details from the `paid_content` table.
        3.  It creates a Stripe Checkout session for a recurring payment.
        4.  The user is redirected to Stripe to complete the payment.
    *   **Tipping:**
        1.  The frontend calls the `create-tip` Supabase function with the `post_id`, `recipient_id`, `amount_cents`, and an optional `message`.
        2.  The function creates a Stripe Checkout session for a one-time payment.
        3.  The user is redirected to Stripe to complete the payment.

*   **Assessment:**
    *   The Stripe integration is fully implemented on the backend and covers all the required payment scenarios.
    *   The use of separate functions for different payment types is a good design choice.
    *   The frontend integration is not fully visible, but the backend is ready to be used.

## 10. AI Chat & AI Persona Profiles

### 10.5 Educational Function

*   **Feature:** Through AI Chat, users receive explanations of complex topics, personalized micro-learning, or interview simulations—linking marketplace and continuous learning.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The `AIChat.tsx` component does not have any educational features.
    *   To implement this feature, the AI chat backend would need to be able to access educational content and generate explanations, quizzes, and simulations.

---

## Summary

The codebase for the social platform is in a good state, with many of the core features and AI-powered functionalities already implemented, at least at the UI level. The developer has done a great job of creating a modern and visually appealing user interface, with a clear and consistent design.

The backend, powered by Supabase and its edge functions, is also well-structured, with dedicated functions for different AI tasks. The use of OpenAI's GPT models for various AI features is a good choice and shows a clear vision for the product.

However, there are some areas that need more work:

*   **Backend Integration:** Many of the UI components are using mock data, and they need to be connected to the backend functions to be fully functional.
*   **Missing Features:** Some of the more advanced features, such as the "Personal Knowledge Graph", "AI-curated Library", and "Collaborative Hiring", are not implemented at all.
*   **Personalization:** While there are some personalization features, such as the AI digest and the smart feed sorter, the personalization could be taken a step further by tailoring the user experience based on the user's activity and interests in more areas of the platform.

Overall, the project is off to a great start, and with some more development effort, it has the potential to become a truly innovative and intelligent social platform.
