# General Overview

This document details the concept of the proposed platform: a next-generation social network powered by artificial intelligence, combining professional networking, project collaboration, content discovery, and learning opportunities. The goal is not to copy traditional platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn), but to build an intelligent ecosystem where users can develop their profiles, collaborate, and access relevant information in a personalized way.

* AI summaries and contextual recommendations.

### 1.3 Flexible Connections

* **Follow** – for quick discovery.
* **Connect** – for closer collaborations.
* **Subscribe** – not just to people, but also to topics, projects, or content collections.
